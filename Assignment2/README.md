## Overview
This project processes PDF files, extracts data, and generates visualizations. The analysis includes five different "pitches," each representing a distinct approach or dataset extracted from the PDFs. The results are stored in separate files named `pitch1`, `pitch2`, `pitch3`, `pitch4`, and `pitch5`.

## Folder Structure
- **samples_pdfs/**: Contains the input PDF files used for analysis.
- **results/**: Stores the output files generated for each pitch.
