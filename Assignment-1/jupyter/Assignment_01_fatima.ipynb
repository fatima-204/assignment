Their cheque range of $300K-$5M comfortably covers the startup's $2M funding need.  The geographical location of the startup in Pakistan may present some logistical challenges, but it shouldn't be a complete deterrent given Go Capital's lack of specified regional limitations. The promising nature of the startup's focus (cancer treatment) could also be a strong incentive for investment. However, the lack of further detail about the startup (e.g., team, traction, IP) and Go Capital (e.g., investment strategy, past portfolio) limits the score.

The startup's focus on a significant medical need (cancer treatment) could be attractive to many investors.  The geographic location of the startup in Pakistan might present a slight hurdle depending on Amiti's investment strategy and experience in emerging markets, but the overall alignment in funding requirements and stage makes this a promising pairing. The lack of detail about Amiti's overview prevents a perfect score; more information on their international investment practices and appetite for risk in emerging markets would provide further clarity.\n",

Their cheque size range of $300K - $3M comfortably covers the startup's $2,000,000 funding request.  The startup's location in Pakistan might present some logistical challenges, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker given the investor's lack of specified country restrictions. The focus on cancer treatment in medicine is a strong positive; the investor will likely find the social impact attractive. The only significant potential hurdle is the large funding request near the top of the investor's range, increasing the chances of a counteroffer or needing to secure additional funding from other sources. Overall, the match is quite strong but not perfect.\n",

The geographical location of the startup (Pakistan) might present a slight hurdle, as the investor's country focus is not specified, but their global presence implies a willingness to consider international opportunities. The startup's focus on a critical area like cancer treatment could be an attractive proposition for a VC looking for high-impact ventures.

The focus on helping people with cancer presents a compelling social impact angle which could appeal to responsible investors like Elevar.  The high score reflects the strong alignment on funding stage and amount, the investor's broad industry focus, and the potential for Elevar to be attracted by the social impact nature of this project; the geographical factor slightly lowers the score.\n",
