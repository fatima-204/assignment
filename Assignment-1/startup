Go Capital,https://www.gocapital.fr/en/,VC,France,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$300K - $5M,0.78,"Go Capital is a VC firm with a sector-agnostic approach and invests in stages ranging from pre-seed to Series+,  perfectly encompassing the startup's idea stage.  Their cheque range of $300K-$5M comfortably covers the startup's $2M funding need.  The geographical location of the startup in Pakistan may present some logistical challenges, but it shouldn't be a complete deterrent given Go Capital's lack of specified regional limitations. The promising nature of the startup's focus (cancer treatment) could also be a strong incentive for investment. However, the lack of further detail about the startup (e.g., team, traction, IP) and Go Capital (e.g., investment strategy, past portfolio) limits the score.  More information would enable a higher confidence match."
Amiti,https://www.amiti.vc/,VC,Israel,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed",$2M - $5M,0.78,"Amiti, being a sector-agnostic VC with a cheque size range encompassing the startup's funding needs and a preference for idea-stage companies, presents a strong potential match.  The startup's focus on a significant medical need (cancer treatment) could be attractive to many investors.  The geographic location of the startup in Pakistan might present a slight hurdle depending on Amiti's investment strategy and experience in emerging markets, but the overall alignment in funding requirements and stage makes this a promising pairing. The lack of detail about Amiti's overview prevents a perfect score; more information on their international investment practices and appetite for risk in emerging markets would provide further clarity."
Identity Ventures,https://identity.vc/,VC,Germany,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$300K - $3M,0.78,"Identity Ventures is a sector-agnostic VC firm that invests in early-stage companies, including ideas.  Their cheque size range of $300K - $3M comfortably covers the startup's $2,000,000 funding request.  The startup's location in Pakistan might present some logistical challenges, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker given the investor's lack of specified country restrictions. The focus on cancer treatment in medicine is a strong positive; the investor will likely find the social impact attractive. The only significant potential hurdle is the large funding request near the top of the investor's range, increasing the chances of a counteroffer or needing to secure additional funding from other sources. Overall, the match is quite strong but not perfect."
Real Tech Holdings,https://en.realtech.holdings/,VC,Japan,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$300K - $3M,0.78,"Real Tech Holdings is a VC firm with a sector-agnostic approach and invests in various stages, including idea stage, which aligns perfectly with the startup's stage.  Their cheque range ($300K-$3M) comfortably covers the startup's funding needs ($2M).  The geographical location of the startup (Pakistan) might present a slight hurdle, as the investor's country focus is not specified, but their global presence implies a willingness to consider international opportunities. The startup's focus on a critical area like cancer treatment could be an attractive proposition for a VC looking for high-impact ventures.  The lower score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the lack of information regarding Real Tech Holdings' international investment strategy."
Hibernia Private,http://www.hiberniaprivate.com/,Other,Ireland,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$500K - $5M,0.78,"Hibernia Private's sector-agnostic approach and investment range ($500K - $5M) are highly compatible with the startup's needs ($2,000,000).  The startup's idea stage aligns with Hibernia's preference for investing in Pre-seed, Idea, and other early stages.  The geographical location of the startup (Pakistan) may present a slight hurdle, as Hibernia's country focus is not specified, but their broad investment strategy suggests this is unlikely to be a significant barrier. The high match score reflects the strong alignment in funding requirements and investment stage preference, offset slightly by geographical uncertainty."
Elevar Equity,https://www.elevarequity.com,VC,India,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$1M - $10M,0.78,"Elevar Equity is a VC firm with a sector-agnostic approach and invests in stages ranging from pre-seed to Series+, making them a strong potential fit for this early-stage medical startup.  Their cheque size comfortably covers the startup's funding requirements.  The startup's location in Pakistan may present a slight geographical challenge, depending on Elevar's investment strategy beyond India (as the 'Countries' field is N/A); however, given their pan-India presence and investment in similar-stage companies, this is not a major impediment. The focus on helping people with cancer presents a compelling social impact angle which could appeal to responsible investors like Elevar.  The high score reflects the strong alignment on funding stage and amount, the investor's broad industry focus, and the potential for Elevar to be attracted by the social impact nature of this project; the geographical factor slightly lowers the score."
White Rhino Ventures,https://whiterhino.ventures/,VC,United States,Sector Agnostic,"Idea, Prototype/MVP, Pre-seed, Seed",$250K - $5M,0.78,"White Rhino Ventures is a VC firm that invests in Idea stage startups, aligning perfectly with the startup's stage.  Their cheque range ($250K - $5M) comfortably covers the startup's funding requirement of $2,000,000.  Their sector-agnostic approach means industry is not a barrier. The geographical location of the startup in Pakistan might present some logistical challenges, but shouldn't be an insurmountable hurdle for a globally operating VC. The potential for high returns in the medicine industry, especially concerning cancer treatment, may outweigh this geographical concern."
Framework Ventures,https://framework.ventures/,VC,Canada,Sector Agnostic,"Pre-seed, Idea, Prototype/MVP, Seed, Series+",$500K - $5M,0.78,"Framework Ventures is a VC firm with a sector-agnostic approach and invests across various stages, including idea-stage startups.  Their cheque size range of $500K-$5M comfortably covers the startup's $2M funding request. The startup's location in Pakistan may present some logistical challenges, but given Framework's global reach and lack of specified country restrictions, this is not a significant deterrent. The focus on a medicine-related venture for a critical condition like cancer could be attractive to investors, potentially adding to the overall match score.  The lower score reflects the geographical distance and potential added complexities associated with investing in a startup based in Pakistan, requiring due diligence and potentially different regulatory considerations."
